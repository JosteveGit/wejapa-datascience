# Write a script that does the following:

# Ask for user input 3 times. Once for a list of names, once for a list of missing assignment counts, and once for a
# list of grades. Use this input to create lists for names, assignments, and grades. Use a loop to print the message
# for each student with the correct values. The potential grade is simply the current grade added to two times the
# number of missing assignments. Template code for your script:

names = input("Enter names 5 names separated by comma: ").split(",")  # get and process input for a list of names
assignments = input("Enter 5 missing assignment separated by comma: ").split(
    ",")  # get and process input for a list of the number of assignments
grades = input("Enter names 5 names separated by comma: ").split(",")  # get and process input for a list of grades

# message string to be used for each student
# HINT: use .format() with this string in your for loop
for n, i in enumerate(names):
    message = "Hi {},\n\nThis is a reminder that you have {} assignments left to \
submit before you can graduate. You're current grade is {} and can increase \
to {} if you submit all assignments before the due date.\n\n"
    print(message.format(i, assignments[n], grades[n], int((assignments[n])) + (int(grades[n])*2) ))

# write a for loop that iterates through each set of names, assignments, and grades to print each student's message
